## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###

We have chosen [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?category=Sans+Serif) for all of the headers and [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?category=Sans+Serif) the rest of the text.

### Colours ###

We have chosen the colour that say ... appealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Colour palette](wireframes/Palette.png)

- *Grullo* (AF9483) - Light soft brown
- *Umber* (615550) - Dark brown
- *Alabaster* (F0EDE5) - Off white

These colours will compliment each other well when used across the site creating pleasant ambience.

### Wireframes ###

We designed our site mock-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).
